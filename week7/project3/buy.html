      <h2>C H Token</h2>
      <h6>August 14th 2021</h6>
      <p>The Git Hub protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.</p>
      <p>Because of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Git Hub enjoys interest from small-time traders and institutional traders alike. A significant focus for the Git Hub Foundation is to make decentralized finance accessible on a larger scale.</p>
      <p>The Git Hub protocol is intended to serve both small-time users and enterprise customers alike. One of Git Hub’s main promises to customers is that they will not be surprised by increased fees and taxes. The protocol is designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing scalability and fast processing.</p>

      <h2>Ethereum</h2>
      <h6>July 30th 2015</h6>
      <p>Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether ( ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain. Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Ethereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee. It also powers applications that everyone can use and no one can take down.</p>
      <p>Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with some big differences.</p>
      <p>Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets – even Bitcoin!</p>

    <h2>Cardano</h2>
    <h6>July 9th 2013</h6>
    <p>Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods. It combines pioneering technologies to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and societies.</p>
    <p>With a leading team of engineers, Cardano exists to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins – to individuals – and be an enabling force for positive change and progress.</p>
    <p>Cardano restores trust to global systems – creating, through science, a more secure, transparent, and sustainable foundation for individuals to transact and exchange, systems to govern, and enterprises to grow.</p>
    <p>Cardano brings a new standard in technology – open and inclusive – to challenge the old and activate a new age of sustainable, globally-distributed innovation.</p>

      <h2>Bitcoin</h2>
      <h6>August 18th 2008</h6>
      <p>Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are made with no middle men – meaning, no banks! Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on Expedia, shop for furniture on Overstock and buy Xbox games. But much of the hype is about getting rich by trading it. The price of bitcoin skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017.</p>
      <p>Bitcoins can be used to buy merchandise anonymously. In addition, international payments are easy and cheap because bitcoins are not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Small businesses may like them because there are no credit card fees. Some people just buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping that they’ll go up in value.</p>
      <p>No one knows what will become of bitcoin. It is mostly unregulated, but some countries like Japan, China and Australia have begun weighing regulations. Governments are concerned about taxation and their lack of control over the currency.</p>
